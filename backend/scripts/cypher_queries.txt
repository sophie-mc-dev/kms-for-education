the module status comes from user_module_progress table and is updated when checkAnswers is clicked. 

module status changes between locked, in progress and completed. when a module is started by the user it changes from locked to in progress and when a user passes the assessment it changes from in progress to completed. these changes are reflected in the user module progress table. 

but they also need to be reflected in the learning path progress table as in update the current module id, completed modules[], progress percentage based on locked modules and completed modules, locked modules[]. in the frontend theres no logic to handle this yet...

perhaps, based on the entry in user_module_progress the fields in learning path progress can be calculated... 

so when an assessment is completed, the module entry in user module progress, for that learning path is updated. then, based on the status and learning path progress it updates the fields. 

the learning path progress should be updated right after the checkanswers is submitted. this way relating the learning path page, module card and assessment with a different api point and exhange of data.


if (learningPathId) {
        // Update for learning path modules
        updateQuery = `
                UPDATE user_module_progress 
                SET assessment_status = $1, 
                    status = $2
                WHERE user_id = $3 AND module_id = $4 AND learning_path_id = $5
            `;
        updateValues = [
          assessmentStatus,
          moduleStatus,
          user_id,
          module_id,
          learningPathId,
        ];
      } else {
        // Update for standalone modules
        updateQuery = `
                UPDATE user_module_progress 
                SET assessment_status = $1, 
                    status = $2, 
                    completed_at = NOW()
                WHERE user_id = $3 AND module_id = $4 AND learning_path_id IS NULL
            `;

            

Model Data in Neo4j 
Import Existing PostgreSQL Data 
Ensure Real-Time Sync Between PostgreSQL and Neo4j 
Build a Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm 
Create API Endpoints for Recommendations 

ENTITIES:
- Users {id, name, email, role}
- Resources {id, title, description, tags, category}
- Modules {id, title, description}
- Learning Paths {id, title, description}

- Tags
- Categories

EXAMPLE:
(User)-[:VIEWED]->(Resource)-[:HAS_TAG]->(Tag)
(User)-[:COMPLETED]->(Module)-[:CONTAINS]->(Resource)
(LearningPath)-[:INCLUDES]->(Module)
This structure allows both content-based (via tags) and collaborative filtering (via user behavior).

(:User)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(:Resource)  
(:Resource)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Module)  
(:Module)-[:PART_OF]->(:LearningPath)  
(:Resource)-[:HAS_TAG]->(:Tag)  

ðŸ“Œ A. Content-Based Recommendations (Based on Resource Tags)
Recommends resources based on shared tags between resources a user interacted with.

MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r:Resource)
MATCH (r)-[:HAS_TAG]->(t:Tag)<-[:HAS_TAG]-(r2:Resource)
WHERE NOT (u)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r2)
RETURN r2.id, r2.title, COUNT(t) AS relevance
ORDER BY relevance DESC
LIMIT 5;
Use Case: If a user interacted with "Machine Learning Basics," suggest "Deep Learning Fundamentals" (same tag: "AI").


ðŸ“Œ B. Collaborative Recommendations (Users Who Liked Similar Resources)
Finds users with similar interests and recommends what they interacted with but you havenâ€™t.

MATCH (u1:User {id: $userId})-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r:Resource)
MATCH (u2:User)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r)
WHERE u1 <> u2
WITH u2, COUNT(r) AS shared_interactions
ORDER BY shared_interactions DESC
LIMIT 5
MATCH (u2)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r2:Resource)
WHERE NOT (u1)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r2)
RETURN r2.id, r2.title, COUNT(*) AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
Use Case: If Alice and Bob both liked "Intro to AI," recommend Bob other resources Alice liked.

ðŸ“Œ C. Hybrid Recommendation (Combining Both)
Combines content-based and collaborative filtering by ranking recommendations from both queries.

MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r:Resource)
MATCH (r)-[:HAS_TAG]->(t:Tag)<-[:HAS_TAG]-(r2:Resource)
WHERE NOT (u)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r2)
WITH r2, COUNT(t) AS tag_score

MATCH (u1:User {id: $userId})-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r:Resource)
MATCH (u2:User)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r)
WHERE u1 <> u2
WITH u2, r, tag_score
ORDER BY COUNT(r) DESC
LIMIT 5

MATCH (u2)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r2:Resource)
WHERE NOT (u1)-[:INTERACTED_WITH]->(r2)
RETURN r2.id, r2.title, (tag_score + COUNT(*)) AS hybrid_score
ORDER BY hybrid_score DESC
LIMIT 5;
Use Case: Balances resource similarity and collaborative filtering for more relevant recommendations.


ADD BOOKMARKED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN USERS AND RESOURCES:

MATCH (u:User {id: $userId}), (r:Resource {id: $resourceId})
MERGE (u)-[:BOOKMARKED {timestamp: timestamp()}]->(r)

const getRecommendedResourcesBasedOnBookmarks = async (userId) => {
    const result = await session.run(
        `MATCH (u1:User {id: $userId})-[:BOOKMARKED]->(r:Resource)<-[:BOOKMARKED]-(u2:User)
         MATCH (u2)-[:BOOKMARKED]->(recommended:Resource)
         WHERE NOT (u1)-[:BOOKMARKED]->(recommended)
         RETURN DISTINCT recommended ORDER BY rand() LIMIT 5;`,
        { userId }
    );

    return result.records.map(record => record.get("recommended").properties);
};

ðŸ“Œ Add Bookmark in PostgreSQL & Sync to Neo4j

const bookmarkResource = async (userId, resourceId) => {
    await pool.query(
        `INSERT INTO bookmarks (user_id, resource_id) 
         VALUES ($1, $2) ON CONFLICT (user_id, resource_id) DO NOTHING`,
        [userId, resourceId]
    );
    
    await syncBookmarkToNeo4j(userId, resourceId);
};



Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of your backend tasks for the next two weeks, ensuring your system is stable and ready for AI, semantic web, and recommendation implementation.

ðŸ”¹ Backend To-Do List (March 19 - March 31)
ðŸ“Œ 1. Finalizing Core System & Data Management (March 19 - March 24)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Ensure the backend correctly handles resource management, learning paths, and module tracking.

âœ… Tasks:
ðŸ”¹ Resource Management System:

 Fix PDF to HTML conversion issue (test pdf.js, PyMuPDF, or Pandoc).
 Ensure all file types (PDF, DOCX, PPT) convert correctly and store text metadata.
 Implement metadata extraction (title, author, keywords, topics) for better search.
 Store extracted metadata in Neo4j and PostgreSQL for efficient querying.
 Enable full-text search indexing for resources.
 Ensure resources correctly link to their respective learning paths in the database.
ðŸ”¹ Learning Paths & Modules:

 API to fetch user-specific learning paths and modules.
 Implement progress tracking API:
User starts/stops a learning path â†’ update progress.
Modules marked as complete â†’ LP progress updates.
 Add endpoints to associate modules with learning paths dynamically.
 Optimize query performance for fetching LP details with associated resources.
ðŸ”¹ Dashboard & User Management:

 Backend logic for tracking recently viewed resources and LPs.
 API to fetch and return recommended resources based on past activity (placeholder for recommendation system).
 Implement user role management (student, admin, instructor).
ðŸ“Œ 2. Neo4j Knowledge Graph & Ontology Integration (March 25 - March 31)
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Integrate semantic web technologies and prepare for AI recommendations.

âœ… Tasks:
ðŸ”¹ Neo4j Graph Database Setup:

 Define node types: User, Resource, Module, LearningPath, Topic.
 Define relationships:
:RECOMMENDS â†’ Resource to Resource
:PART_OF â†’ Module to Learning Path
:REQUIRES â†’ Dependencies between modules
:BELONGS_TO â†’ Resource to Topic
 Migrate existing relational data to Neo4j nodes & relationships.
ðŸ”¹ Ontology & Semantic Web Queries (ProtÃ©gÃ© + SPARQL):

 Design ontology structure in ProtÃ©gÃ©.
 Implement SPARQL queries for semantic search (fetch similar resources based on ontology).
 Connect ProtÃ©gÃ© ontology to Neo4j Knowledge Graph.
ðŸ”¹ Recommendation Engine (Preparation Phase):

 Data Preprocessing: Clean and structure data for recommendation model.
 Implement basic recommendation API (return similar resources based on metadata + Neo4j relationships).
 Expose API for frontend integration (return ranked recommendations).
ðŸ”¹ By April 1, Backend Should Have:
âœ… Stable resource and learning path management system.
âœ… Full metadata extraction and searchable database.
âœ… Neo4j integrated with semantic relationships.
âœ… Basic recommendation system ready for testing.
