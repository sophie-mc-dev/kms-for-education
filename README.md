## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Follow these steps to get `kms-for-education` up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the `kms-for-education` repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sophie-mc-dev/kms-for-education.git
    cd kms-for-education
    ```

2.  **Create the Databases**

      - **Postgres**: 
         - Create a local database and add the connection string to .env. 
         - A `.sql` file is stored in the `/backend/utils` folder with the structure from the PostgreSQL database.

      - **Neo4j**:
         - Either run locally and enable the APOC plugin, OR
         - Run with Docker (requires plugin configuration).

      - **Elasticsearch**
         - Create Docker container:

         ```
         docker run -d \
         --name elasticsearch \
         -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
         -p 9200:9200 \
         docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.10.2
         ```

3.  **Configure the Repository**

      The project uses a `.env` file for configuration.  
      Each developer should create their own `.env` file in the `backend/` directory.

      Key variables include:
      - `POSTGRES_HOST=...`
      - `NEO4J_URI=...`
      - `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...` (‚ö†Ô∏è R2 disabled, update or replace)

      ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
      With the correct `.env` variables, the backend will automatically connect to the databases. The database configuration files are stored in the `/backend/scripts` folder.

4.  **Run frontend and backend services**

      To run the frontend and backend services independently for development purposes run the following commands:

      #### Frontend Setup

      ```bash
      # From the project root
      cd frontend
      npm install 
      npm run dev
      ```

      #### Backend Setup

      ```bash
      # From the project root
      cd backend
      npm install 
      npm run dev
      ```


## üöÄ Usage
Once the application is running, open the platform in your browser.
You can create different users (student and educator) to view distinct role-based screens and functionalities.
